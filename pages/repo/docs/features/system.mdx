# System

As you can see, the obelisk engine system is accompanied by a developer-defined data structure derived from the instructions of the operating system in the previous article on the structure of the counter component, based on which you can create a counter_system to expose to the outside world to perform the operation transaction methods

```rust

module counter::system {
    use eps::world::{World, get_mut_entity};
    use eps::entity::get_component;


    public entry fun counter_change(world:&mut World,entity_id: u64,component_id:u64){
        let entity = get_mut_entity(world,entity_id);
        let counter = get_component(entity,component_id);
        counter::counter::counter_change(counter);
    }
}


```
