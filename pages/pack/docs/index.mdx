# What’s Obelisk Engine?

Obelisk Engine is a framework for ambitious Move applications. It compresses the complexity of building Move apps with a tightly integrated software stack.

    Obelisk Engine is currently in <strong>beta</strong>. It is not yet ready for production use. We appreciate your support and feedback as we work to make it ready for everyone.

## What Obelisk Engine isn't

- Obelisk Engine **is not a rollup or a chain**: it’s a set of libraries and tools that work well together to build onchain applications.
- Obelisk Engine **is not specific to Sui Mainnet**: It works on any Move-compatible chains. Solana,Sui,Aptos,Starcoin,Rooch you name it.
- Obelisk Engine **is not just for Autonomous Worlds and Onchain Games**, although it has been a framework of choice in that community.
- Obelisk Engine **doesn’t force a data model onto the developer (ie: not just EPS)**: anything you can do with flat Move mappings and arrays, you can do with Obelisk Engine.
