# Getting Started

If you haven’t already, check out the Introduction to learn more about Obelisk Engine before beginning.

In this tutorial you will create your first Obelisk project and gain an understanding of its structure. We will also explore Obelisk’s built in dev tools.

Before we begin let’s make sure your local environment is setup with the proper prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

1. git ([download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
3. node.js (v18+) ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
4. pnpm (after installing node: `npm install --global pnpm`)

If you are using Windows:

**Windows steps**

1. install git bash (gitforwindows.org)
2. install `nodejs`, including “native modules” (nodejs.org/en/download) (re native modules: just keep the checkmark, it’s enabled by default in the installer)

## Project setup

To start off let’s create your Obelisk project from a template by running the following pnpm command.


```bash
pnpm create obelisk-world my-project
```

At this point you will see the option of choosing a template—as of writing the two options are **nextjs**, **cocos**. For the sake of this tutorial any of them works, but examples from the **nextjs** template will be used here.

After selecting your template you can run the app by switching into the project directory (`cd my-project`) and starting the development server.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
