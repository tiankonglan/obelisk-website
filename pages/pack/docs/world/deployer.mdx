## The Deployer

To deploy a World and its resources, there exists a `deploy` command on the [Components CLI](../cli).

When using the deployer, you must set the private key of the deployer using the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable. You can make this easier by using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) before running `Components deploy` in your deployment script.
