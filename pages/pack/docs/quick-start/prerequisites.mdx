# Prerequisites

Before we begin let’s make sure your local environment is setup with the proper prerequisites.


## Node Environment

1. node.js (v18+) ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
2. pnpm (after installing node: `npm install --global pnpm`)

If you are using Windows:

**Windows steps**

1. install git bash (gitforwindows.org)
2. install `nodejs`, including “native modules” (nodejs.org/en/download) (re native modules: just keep the checkmark, it’s enabled by default in the installer)


## Sui Binaries

There are two main approaches for obtaining Sui:

1. Installation:

    1. If you are running on a Unix machine (Linux/macOS), then the simplest option is to download the latest binary.
    
    2. You can also install via Cargo.

2. Alternatively, build Sui directly from source.

> Download or compile the Sui binaries and configure them in the global environment, our CLI will use `sui` and `sui-test-validator`.


### (Method 1) Install by downloading

    Simply head to the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases) page and download the latest version of Sui binary matching your platform:

    - **macOS arm64**: sui-RELEASE_VERSION-macos-arm64.tgz
    - **macOS x86**: sui-RELEASE_VERSION-macos-x86_64.tgz
    - **Linux**: sui-RELEASE_VERSION-ubuntu-x86_64.tgz
    - **Windows**: sui-RELEASE_VERSION-windows-x86_64.tgz

    If you are using macOS/Linux:

    The step-by-step instruction below should carry you through the whole process:

        1. Make the directory where we'll place the binary:

            ```bash
            mkdir -p $HOME/.sui/bin
            ```

        2. Extract the binary archive:
            
            ```bash
            tar -C $HOME/.sui/bin/ -vxzf $ARCHIVE_NAME && mv $HOME/.sui/target/release/* $HOME/.sui/bin && rm -rf $HOME/.sui/target
            ```
        3. Rename binary:
            ```bash
                # sui-test-validator-($platform) for example: sui-test-validator-macos-arm64; sui-($platform) for example: sui-macos-arm64
                mv $HOME/.sui/bin/sui-test-validator-($platform) $HOME/.sui/bin/sui-test-validator && mv $HOME/.sui/bin/sui-($platform) $HOME/.sui/bin/sui
            ```

        4. Update your path, by adding this line in your .bashrc or .zshrc shell configuration file:

            ```bash
            export PATH="$HOME/.sui/bin:$PATH"
            ```

        > NOTE: The binary may be initially prevented from running if you're on macOS. See the ["Open Anyway" instructions from this support forum](https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/HT202491) if that is the case.

    If you are using Windows:

    Please unzip $ARCHIVE_NAME and configure sui and sui-test-validator in it to the global environment.


### (Method 2) Build from source

    1. **Clone the repository**

        Open a terminal and clone the sui repository:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git
        ```

        Change to the repository directory

        ```bash
        cd sui
        ```

    2. **Checkout the latest release**

        Go to the [sui releases](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases) page to see what is the most recent release.

        Then checkout the release, for example if the most recent release is testnet-v1.9.0 then execute the command:

        ```bash
        git checkout testnet-v1.9.0
        ```

    3. **Building with cargo build**

        This command builds all the crates from the sui repository, namely: sui, sui-test-validator, sui-faucet etc.

        ```bash
        cargo build --release
        ```

        When using Obelisk, we only need to use `sui` and `sui-test-validator`, so they need to be configured into the global environment.

        ```bash
        # Place the compiled binary in the global environment.
        sudo mv target/release/sui target/release/sui-test-validator /usr/local/bin
        ```


**Finally, Verify that the binary was installed successfully.**

```bash
sui --version
```
