# Project setup

To start off let’s create your Obelisk project from a template by running the following pnpm command.


```bash
pnpm create obelisk-world
```

When you execute this command you will be taken to the command line interaction page, where there are two main interaction steps.

**Step 1. Input your projectName.** 

At the beginning we will be asked to enter the name of the project and the command line will create a project with the same name based on the name you enter. 

For demonstration purposes, we'll define it here as **my_first_project**

**Step 2. Pick your platform.**

At this point you will see the option of choosing a template—as of writing the three options are **101**, **nextjs**, **cocos**. 

For the sake of this tutorial any of them works, but examples from the **101** template will be used here.

**Start my first 101 project**

After selecting your template you can run the app by switching into the project directory (`cd my_first_project`) and starting the development server.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Once the project has been successfully launched, please open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and enjoy your first obelisk project!
