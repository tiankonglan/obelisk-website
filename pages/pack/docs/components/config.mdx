## Components Config & `compgen` Tool

The `compgen` CLI tool generates libraries for Components. It makes it much less error-prone than using the Components low-level API, and comes with typed Move APIs when setting and retrieving records.

### Using `compgen` with the Obelisk framework

If you are using the Obelisk framework and have a `obelisk.config.ts` file in your project, you can edit your Components config directly in this file!
Keep reading from the "Adding Component" section

### Using `compgen` without the Obelisk framework

> We are making this process easier, and will not require a obelisk config in the future in order to use `compgen`

A Components config should be named `obelisk.config.ts`, and placed at the root of your project.

This is the minimal config:

```tsx
import { ObeliskConfig } from "@0xobelisk/common/src/codegen/types";

export const obeliskConfig = {
  projectName: "projectName",
  components: {}, // an empty config with no components
  singletonComponents: {}, // an empty config with no singleton components
} as ObeliskConfig;
```

### Generating the components

To generate the components, run `pnpm obelisk compgen ./obelisk.config.ts` in the same folder as the config file.

### Adding component

Adding a component is done by creating an entry in the `components` object of the config.

```tsx
export const obeliskConfig = {
  projectName: "projectName",
  components: {
      my_component: {
        name: "string",
        age: "u8",
        sex: "bool"
    }
  }, // an empty config with no components
  singletonComponents: {}, // an empty config with no singleton components
} as ObeliskConfig;
```

The key of the entry is the name of the component, and the value is another object: the component configuration.

The component configuration can have these properties:

### Shortcut: componet with a single column

There is a shortcut to create a component with a `vector<u8>` key and a single column in the value schema:

```tsx
components: {
  // Create a component with key uint256 and a single column with type u64
  level: "u64";
}
```

### Singleton components

In order to create Singleton components that do not have keys (and effectively store a single value), you must pass an init value.

Example:

```tsx
singletonComponents: {
  my_singleton_component: {
    counter: {
      type: "u64",
      init: "1000"
    },
  },
}
```

The getter and setter functions will not have a `key` argument.
