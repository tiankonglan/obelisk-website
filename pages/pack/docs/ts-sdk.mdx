# Obelisk SDK

The SDK consists of a `CLI` and a `Client`, the CLI is mainly used to quickly build Obelisk projects and provide some quality development tools, the Client is a tool medium for developers to modify and access the World.

Both sets of tools are now supported on `cocos` and `node`, hope you have fun.
